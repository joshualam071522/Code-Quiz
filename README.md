## Description

The purpose of this project was to build a quiz-type application that has a timer and score feature. This quiz features 5 questions for the user to answer. After time has run out or the user has completed answering the questions, they will be able to see their final score and post it on the highscore list. They can also choose to clear the high score or go back and try again. The main goals in doing this project included improving pure javascript skills and logic.

## Usage

To use the application, All you must do is press the start quiz button and the timer will start. The user will be presented with the first question, and they can choose from any of the four possible answers. Once they do, the next question will pop up and the process will repeat until all five questions are answered. In the case that either the timer runs out or the five questions are answered, the user will be met at the end game screen, where they will be given their final score. They will be able to type their initials and press the submit button to add the score to the high score list. After, they will be taken to the high score list page, and will be able to see the current high scores. From there, they can either clear the high score list or press the go back button to go to the homepage by pressing the respective buttons.
